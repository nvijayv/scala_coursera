Those supporting deletion successfully establish the lack of significant third-party coverage, yet those supporting keeping the article note the success of the business, while it does not make the subject ''inherently'' notable, contributes to an argument thereof, and some argue that there are sufficient sources for inclusion (e.g., Ktr101).

Several third party sources identify metrics which I wouldn't consider "trivial" or "incidental" as per [[WP:CORP|the notability guidline on corporations]] and could even be considered inherently notable, such as [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/beacon-roofing-acquire-mcclure-johnston-130251881.html;_ylt=A0LEVxM23VhU2OwAbvBXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzY2RxajU3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1ZJUDUzMl8x almost $100 in annual sales], [http://www.prosalesmagazine.com/news/distributors/beacon-roofing-supply-opens-location-no-200_o opening over 200 stores, recording almost $2 billion in total sales] and being a large, publicly traded company. Regardless, the article needs work and it leans far too heavily on press releases and self published primary sources.

'''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 22:44, 20 November 2014 (UTC) *'''Delete with a caveat'''  Every ref in the article is a database entry or, more or less, a press release. The closest thing I've found to a [[WP:CORPDEPTH]] compatible article is [http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB52784017629588234037504580170502824412316], which has a few paragraphs of material that attempt depth. But I was unable to find anything in the article itself or this discussion so far that matched it, and the total there is not sufficient. GraniteSand's sources are warmed-over press releases. That the company is NASDAQ-listed does not in my experience demonstrate the existence of good coverage.  Still, with a $1B+ market cap, I would guess that coverage may still exist, yet to be found, perhaps in specialized industry periodicals. The topic ''may'' be able to show notability if a sufficiently informed editor has access to appropriate sources and builds an article from them. This is [[WP:TNT|not that article]], and today, so far, is not that day. --[[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|<sup><small><i>talk</i></small></sup>]] 04:08, 21 November 2014 (UTC) <hr style="width:55%;" /> :<span style="color:#FF4F00;">'''[[WP:RELIST|Relisted]] to generate a more thorough discussion so a clearer consensus may be reached.'''</span><br /> :<small>Please add new comments below this notice.

CORP/LISTED specifically cites analyst reports as examples of coverage that is sufficient to establish notability.  A simple news search (which I linked above) returns [http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/155444/beacon-roofing-becn-falls-on-dismal-q4-amp-2014-earnings this] very indepth analyst report with just 2 weeks ago as the third link.  (There is also a link to get an even more detailed report with free registration to the site.)  If you are classifying that, and many similar quality sources in the same news search, as "routine coverage of announcements" I am baffled.

I.e. they find it interesting. Not that they write about it as it's their job as analysts to routinely write, even at length, about a firm because it's publicly traded. That's my problem with the above source and all the others I found.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 16:33, 4 December 2014 (UTC) *:::That might be your opinion, but notability guidelines disagree.  No exclusion of analyst reports is made, and indeed it is specifically cited as material that conveys notability.  What you consider boring, routine stuff, people interested in business consider exciting.  Business writing normally covers financials (but note most such reports also give background info on what the company does) by people paid to cover financials.  That doesn't make it any less reliable or indepth - the actual notability requirements - nor does it make it indiscriminiate (business analsysts/reports do choose what they write about - no one blindly covers every company in existance!).  To discount business writing because it is about money is like discounting sports writing because it is about a game or literary writing because it is about a book. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 17:31, 4 December 2014 (UTC)  ::::You seem confused about "inherent". Things that are "inherently" something carry that attribute without outside input or consideration.
